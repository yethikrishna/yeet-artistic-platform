## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

#### TypeScript/JavaScript
```typescript
// Use meaningful variable names
const artKeyProgress = calculateArtKeyProgress(userId);

// Add comprehensive comments for complex logic
/**
 * Calculates cultural resonance score based on user's engagement
 * with traditional artistic elements and quantum consciousness concepts
 */
function calculateCulturalResonance(user: User): number {
  // Implementation details...
}

// Use proper TypeScript types
interface ArtKey {
  keyId: string;
  keyName: string;
  culturalSignificance: string;
  requiredActions: string[];
  rewards: ArtKeyRewards;
}
```

#### React Components
```tsx
// Use functional components with hooks
const ArtKeysSection: React.FC<ArtKeysSectionProps> = ({ 
  onTerminalOutput, 
  compact = false 
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};

// Proper prop typing
interface ArtKeysSectionProps {
  onTerminalOutput: (output: string) => void;
  compact?: boolean;
}
```

#### CSS/Styling
```css
/* Follow terminal aesthetic conventions */
.art-key-card {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
  border: 2px solid rgba(249, 202, 36, 0.3);
  border-radius: 12px;
  /* Cultural color significance: gold represents divine knowledge */
}

/* Use meaningful class names */
.carnatic-sequence-input {
  /* Styles specific to Carnatic music input */
}
```

### Database Guidelines

#### Schema Design
```sql
-- Use meaningful table and column names
CREATE TABLE user_art_keys (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    key_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    cultural_notes TEXT, -- Document cultural significance
    unlocked_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Add comprehensive comments
COMMENT ON TABLE user_art_keys IS 'Tracks users unlocked ART KEYS representing artistic mastery progression';
COMMENT ON COLUMN user_art_keys.cultural_notes IS 'Personal reflection on cultural significance of unlocked key';
```

#### Performance Considerations
```sql
-- Add appropriate indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_art_keys_user_id ON user_art_keys(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_art_keys_unlocked_at ON user_art_keys(unlocked_at);

-- Use triggers for automated gamification
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_art_key_progress()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
-- Function implementation
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Test business logic thoroughly
describe('ArtKeyService', () => {
  describe('calculateArtKeyProgress', () => {
    it('should correctly calculate progress for Carnatic music activities', () => {
      const user = createMockUser({ activities: ['upload_carnatic_composition'] });
      const progress = ArtKeyService.calculateProgress(user, 'first_note');
      expect(progress).toBe(25); // 25% progress towards 'first_note' ART KEY
    });

    it('should respect cultural authenticity requirements', () => {
      const invalidActivity = { type: 'inappropriate_cultural_content' };
      expect(() => ArtKeyService.validateActivity(invalidActivity))
        .toThrow('Cultural content must be authentic and respectful');
    });
  });
});
```

#### Integration Tests
```typescript
// Test API endpoints
describe('POST /api/gamification/art-keys/:keyId/unlock', () => {
  it('should unlock ART KEY when requirements are met', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/gamification/art-keys/first_note/unlock')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${userToken}`)
      .expect(200);

    expect(response.body.message).toContain('ART KEY UNLOCKED');
    expect(response.body.artKey.keyName).toBe('First Note - Sa');
  });
});
```

#### Cultural Content Tests
```typescript
// Validate cultural accuracy
describe('Cultural Content Validation', () => {
  it('should validate Carnatic music terminology accuracy', () => {
    const validRaga = 'Shankarabharanam';
    const invalidRaga = 'NonExistentRaga';
    
    expect(CulturalValidator.validateRaga(validRaga)).toBe(true);
    expect(CulturalValidator.validateRaga(invalidRaga)).toBe(false);
  });

  it('should ensure quantum consciousness concepts align with "The Quantum Lotus"', () => {
    const concept = 'Observer consciousness in artistic creation';
    expect(CulturalValidator.validateQuantumConcept(concept)).toBe(true);
  });
});
```
