## 📋 Security Best Practices for Contributors

### For Developers
```typescript
// ✅ DO: Use parameterized queries
const user = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [userId]);

// ❌ DON'T: Use string concatenation
const user = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`);

// ✅ DO: Validate cultural content
const isValidRaga = await CulturalValidator.validateRaga(ragaName);
if (!isValidRaga) {
  throw new Error('Invalid raga name');
}

// ✅ DO: Sanitize user input
const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```

### For Cultural Content
```markdown
<!-- ✅ DO: Provide source verification -->
**Raga**: Shankarabharanam
**Source**: Traditional Carnatic music theory
**Verification**: Confirmed by music academy

<!-- ✅ DO: Include cultural context -->
