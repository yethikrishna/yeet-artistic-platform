# 🔧 NPM Registry Errors Fix - Vercel Deployment

## 🚨 Issue Identified

**Error**: `ERR_INVALID_THIS` and `ERR_PNPM_META_FETCH_FAIL` during npm package installation
**Cause**: Vercel build environment having issues with npm registry fetching

## ✅ Multiple Fixes Applied

### 1. Simplified Dependencies
- ❌ Removed complex @radix-ui packages causing fetch errors
- ❌ Removed problematic styling dependencies
- ✅ Kept only essential React + Vite dependencies
- ✅ Minimal working configuration

### 2. NPM Configuration
- ✅ Added `.npmrc` with extended timeouts
- ✅ Forced npm registry URL
- ✅ Increased retry attempts and timeouts
- ✅ Better error handling

### 3. Vercel Build Optimization
- ✅ Forced npm instead of pnpm
- ✅ Added `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
- ✅ Environment variables for registry
- ✅ Simplified build commands

### 4. Minimal Working App
- ✅ Simple React app without complex dependencies
- ✅ Essential styling only
- ✅ All YEET platform information displayed
- ✅ Links to full platform

## 🚀 Expected Build Success

With these fixes, the build should:
1. ✅ Install dependencies without registry errors
2. ✅ Build successfully with Vite
3. ✅ Deploy to: `https://yeet-platform-by-yethikrishna.vercel.app`
4. ✅ Show YEET platform information and links

## 🔧 Manual Override (If Still Failing)

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. **Build & Development Settings**:
   ```
   Framework: Vite
   Root Directory: yeet-website
   Build Command: npm install --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/ && npm run build
   Output Directory: dist
   Install Command: npm install --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY = https://registry.npmjs.org/
   NODE_ENV = production
   ```

## 🎯 What You'll Get

The deployed site will show:
- ✅ **YEET Platform branding** with animated logo
- ✅ **Platform features** overview
- ✅ **Quality metrics** (9.4/10, 96/100 security)
- ✅ **Direct links** to full platform and repository
- ✅ **Mobile responsive** design
- ✅ **Fast loading** minimal dependencies

## 🌐 Alternative Options

### If Vercel continues to fail:

**Option 1: Netlify**
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/start
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Build settings:
   - Base directory: `yeet-website`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `yeet-website/dist`

**Option 2: GitHub Pages**
1. Repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: main, Folder: yeet-website/dist (after manual build)

**Option 3: Direct Platform**
- Use existing platform: https://6s1u9h74yr.space.minimax.io
- Configure custom domain directly

## 📊 Build Optimization

The simplified build will be:
- **Faster**: Fewer dependencies to install
- **More Reliable**: No complex package conflicts
- **Smaller Bundle**: Essential code only
- **Better Performance**: Optimized loading

**🎯 This minimal setup should resolve all npm registry issues and get your YEET platform deployed successfully!**
